# CoNLL-U Data

This directory contains Ancient Greek dependency treebank data for Lyceum texts, loaded in the [CoNLL-U visualizer](https://conllu.lyceum.quest/) and available for other Lyceum tooling.

CoNLL-U is a tabular format for token-level linguistic annotation. These files combine Greek text, lemmata, part-of-speech tags, morphology, dependency relations, sentence translations, and contextual English glosses.

## Contents

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `aesop/fables/` | 52 Aesop fables as individual `.conllu` files. File names include an English slug, Perry number, and reading-difficulty order. |
| `aesop/fables/perry-difficulty-map.csv` / `.json` | Difficulty ranking for the Aesop files, based on word count, vocabulary diversity, and sentence complexity. |
| `aesop/fables/conllu-edition-map.json` | CTS/Lyceum edition metadata for Aesop treebank editions. |
| `aristotle/poetics/aristotle.poetics.tb.conllu` | Aristotle's *Poetics* treebank. |
| `xenophon/anabasis/book-01.tb.conllu` | Xenophon's *Anabasis*, Book 1 treebank. |

## Format

Files use [CoNLL-U](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html): one token per tab-separated row with the standard 10 columns:

```text
ID FORM LEMMA UPOS XPOS FEATS HEAD DEPREL DEPS MISC
```

The annotations follow Universal Dependencies v2.x conventions adapted for Ancient Greek.

Important columns:

- `FORM` — surface Greek token.
- `LEMMA` — dictionary headword.
- `UPOS` — Universal Dependencies part of speech.
- `XPOS` — more detailed, project-specific morphological label.
- `FEATS` — UD morphological features such as case, number, gender, tense, mood, voice, and person.
- `HEAD` / `DEPREL` — syntactic dependency tree.
- `MISC` — contextual glosses and citation references such as `gloss=...` and `Ref=...`.

## Sentence metadata

Sentence comment blocks commonly include:

- Greek text (`text`) or source citation metadata.
- `translation_lang = en`.
- `prose_translation` for natural English translation.
- `literal_translation` for more word-by-word English.
- Work-specific IDs such as `sent_id`, `sentence_id`, `parallel_id`, `document_id`, `subdoc`, and `Ref`.

Aesop files also use Perry-numbered IDs and Lyceum parallel IDs. Larger imported treebanks preserve source references in token or sentence metadata.

## Provenance and licensing

These files were produced for the Lyceum Digital Library and related Greek treebanking work. They include a mix of manual, LLM-assisted, and Glaux-derived annotations.

Per-file headers contain the authoritative provenance, source edition, editor/annotator, conversion method, contact, and license metadata. Preserve those headers when modifying or redistributing individual files.
